This guide will inform you how to setup a zipped copy of BepInEx configured to be compatible with Thunderstore and additionally demonstrate how you can keep a collection of packages on your local machine.

After completing this guide you should have the tools you need to:
* Create a new Package for Thunderstore manually
* Setup BepInEx for a game without a preconfigured BepInEx Package on Thunderstore

## Download BepInEx

The first thing you should do is download a copy of BepInEx that is compatible with the game you're modding.

Refer to the BepInEx Documentation, [Installing BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) for details on compatibility and dowlnoading BepInEx.

## Create Local Thunderstore Source

Start by creating a LocalThunderstoreSource under the ThunderKit/Settings window by clicking the Add button under the PackageSourceSettings section.
